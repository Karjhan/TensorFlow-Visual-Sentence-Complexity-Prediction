# TensorFlow-Visual-Sentence-Complexity-Prediction

## Description
This is a project for **Practical Machine Learning** course in *Artificial Intelligence Master* course of FMI Unibuc. It's supposed to 
cover to follow the results for a Kaggle Competition about visual complexity for a dataset containing English sentences. Multiple supervised
methods were attempted including CNNs and machine learning algorithms.
For more information, the documentation is attached to the rest of the files.

## The stack:
- Python as the overall PL in Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplot, Tensorflow, Sklearn, NLTK for data exploration and training

## Installation
1. Above the list of files, click <>Code.
2. Copy the desired URL for the repository (HTTPS, SSH), or use Github CLI.
3. Open Git Bash on your machine.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory:
    ```bash
        cd <workdir_name>
    ```
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier:
    ```bash
        git clone <copied_URL>
    ```
6. Run the notebook on a `Jupyter Server`, or watch the existing results

## Final Note
Not much to show in terms of visuals of GUI. This was more of a research project were
documentation was the most important. Advice: given a problem/topic in a Kaggle competition, 
a really important step is to structure and preprocess your data very well. It can give a 
significant advantage.
